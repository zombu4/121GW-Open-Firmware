# User guide: the new features of the fast build

Everything on this page is in the **fast build** (`2_fast/EEVBlog.bin`). The `1_like_v2.05` build behaves like the
original firmware apart from the defect fixes and has none of these features. At power-on the fast build shows its
version, `F-1.16` (the release number, v1.1.6), on the small display; the main display stays blank until the first
reading. The `1_like_v2.05` build shows `V-2.05` like the original.

All settings are stored in bytes of the data EEPROM that the original firmware never uses. Calibration, serial number
and the original settings are not touched, and a meter flashed back to v2.05 simply ignores the new bytes.

## The SETUP menu in short

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Next page | press **SETUP** |
| Start changing the shown setting (the value blinks) | hold **SETUP** about half a second, until the long beep |
| Change the value | **REL** = next value, **PEAK** = previous value |
| Save | hold **SETUP** again until the long beep |
| Leave without saving | press **SETUP** |
| Open the meter pages | on the page `SEt`, hold **SETUP** until the long beep |

If you start changing a setting and then press nothing for about two minutes, the change is undone. Only a saved
setting is kept over a power-off.

The pages come in two groups (GitHub issue 24: one long walk had grown to about twenty pages).

**Measurement pages** (press **SETUP**): the temperature page → the function's own pages of the original (dBm in ACV,
the continuity threshold in BEEP, the current option, `bd`) → `rEL` (REL mode) → `tc` (thermocouple type, TEMP only) →
`dSP` (display level) → `CLP` (current clamp, DCV / ACV / mV only) → `bH` (continuity hold, BEEP only) → `th`, `HY` (your continuity threshold and hysteresis, BEEP
with `DNUSr` or `UPUSr` only) → `LP` (4–20 mA view, DC mA only) → `Pt` (PT100 / PT1000
view, Ω only) → `HUnt` (capacitance anti-hunting, CAP only) → `CHIrP` (diode contact chirp, DIODE only) → `Lt`, `Lo`,
`HI` (limit test; the verdict page while the test is on) → `tr`, `Ch` (logging trigger) → `In` (logging interval) →
(while MIN/MAX is on: the statistics pages `n` and `Sd` and the time pages `tHI` and `tLo`) → `SEt` → back to the
temperature page.

**Meter pages** (on `SEt` hold **SETUP**): battery → `bAt` (battery type, alkaline or NiMH) → `APO` (auto power-off) → `b-On` (buzzer) → `Lcd` (contrast) →
year → month and day → hour and minute → ID → `bL` (backlight) → `bt` (Bluetooth speed) → `Ld` (firmware and files over
Bluetooth) → `Fr` (format the card as exFAT, only with the new bootloader) → `CL` (12 / 24-hour clock) → `bAcK` (F-1.26,
GitHub issue 31: SETUP there, short or long, goes straight back) → the temperature page.  Changing the function or
switching off also ends the meter pages.

The dBm reference is not a new page: it is edited on the existing dBm page of ACV.

## Backlight auto-off and memory

- **Light on / off:** hold **MODE**, as on the original firmware.
- **Auto-off time:** page `bL`. Values: `bLOFF` (never switch off, the default), `bL30S` (30 seconds; the display draws
  S like a 5), `bL  1` to `bL 99` (minutes).
- **After an auto-off:** any key press or dial turn switches the light back on for the set time. That key press only
  wakes the light and does nothing else; a dial turn also changes the function as usual. Every key press and dial turn
  while the light is on starts the time again.
- **Memory:** the meter remembers whether you last switched the light on or off with **MODE** and restores it at
  power-on and after an auto power-off. A switch-off by the timer does not change what is remembered.

Tip: `bL 1` or `bL 2` saves the batteries in a dark place without having to remember to switch the light off.

## dBm reference (ACV)

The ACV function has a dBm page in SETUP; the original always computes dBm into 600 ohm.

- **Where:** dial to **V**, press **MODE** for ACV, press **SETUP** until the dBm value shows (units dB m).
- **Change:** hold **SETUP**; the page shows the reference: `r 600` (default, as the original), `r  50`, `r  75`,
  `r dbV`. **REL** / **PEAK** step through them, hold **SETUP** to save.
- **Meaning:** dBm into 600 ohm (audio), 50 ohm (RF), 75 ohm (video), or dBV (decibels relative to 1 volt). For dBV
  only the dB sign is lit.
- The Bluetooth packet has no code for dBV, so other Bluetooth apps label every reference "dBm".

Check: 1.000 V reads 2.218 dBm (600 ohm), 13.01 dBm (50 ohm), 11.25 dBm (75 ohm), 0.000 dBV.

## Bluetooth speed

- **Bluetooth on / off:** hold **1ms PEAK** until **BT** shows / disappears, as on the original firmware.
- **Auto power-off time (F-1.18 or newer):** the SETUP page APO (the second page, as on the original firmware) offers
  `APO.oF` (off), `APO. 1`, `APO.15`, `APO.30` (the default) and `APO.60` minutes: hold SETUP until the value blinks,
  REL / PEAK to change, hold SETUP to save.  While MIN/MAX is on the time is doubled (as the original doubles 30 to 60
  minutes).  The five warning beeps come in the last minute, with the 1-minute time in the last 15 seconds.  The time
  is stored in EEPROM byte 0x02B; on / off stays in the original byte 0x016.
- **After an auto power-off (F-1.18 or newer):** any key press or a dial turn switches the meter on again, and Bluetooth
  comes back on if it was on before the power-off. (F-1.17 and older did not wake from a key: only the dial off and on
  again started them, OF-73.)
- **Speed:** page `bt`: `bt  2` (2 readings per second, the default, as the original), `bt  4`, `bt 10`, `bt 20`.
- Verified working on a meter: 20 readings per second with EEVblog's own app on an iPhone.

Tip: use `bt 10` or `bt 20` for live plotting on a phone or computer, `bt  2` when battery life matters more.

- **Meters with the old BLE112 module** (F-1.25 on, GitHub issue 30): that module carries about 150 bytes a second,
  about 8 readings.  The 121GW Companion sets the rate for the connection by itself: it starts at the lowest rate, 2 a
  second, goes up one step after a minute without a damaged byte and down again at the first damaged readings, never
  above the saved `bt` value; if the meter drops back to its own rate (a restart, a wake, a key on page `bt`), the
  companion sets it again (companion 1.2.31).  This rate
  lasts until the meter is switched off; the saved `bt` setting is not changed.

## REL in percent

- **Where:** page `rEL`: `rEL-d` (difference, the default, as the original) or `rEL-P` (percent).
- **Use:** with `rEL-P` saved, press **REL** as usual: the reading at that moment becomes the reference, and the meter
  shows how far the present reading is from it **in percent**, with the % sign instead of V, A, ohm and so on.
  Press **REL** again to return to the normal reading.
- **Resolution:** 0.001 % below 100 %, then 0.01 %, 0.1 % and 1 % up to 99999 %. Above that the display shows OFL; a
  reference of exactly zero shows `-----`.
- Logging, MIN/MAX and Bluetooth keep the normal REL value; only the display shows percent.

Tip: sorting parts against a nominal value. Measure a known-good part, press **REL**, then each part shows its deviation
in percent directly (for example 1 % resistors should stay within -1.000 .. 1.000).

## Thermocouple type K, J, T, N, R or S (TEMP)

- **Where:** dial to **mV / Temp**, press **MODE** until TEMP, then page `tc` (it is only offered in TEMP):
  `tc-K` (default, as the original), `tc-J`, `tc-t`, `tc-n`, `tc-r`, `tc-S`.
- **Ranges:** K -200 .. 1350 °C (as the original), J -200 .. 936 °C, T -200 .. 400 °C, N -200 .. 1300 °C, R and S
  -50 .. 1760 °C. Outside the range the display shows OFL. J stops at 936 °C because the meter's TEMP input is only proven up to the voltage K reaches at 1350 °C;
  a J thermocouple reaches that voltage at 936 °C.
- The cold junction (meter temperature) is compensated with the curve of the chosen type. All curves are the official
  NIST ITS-90 tables.
- R and S (platinum) thermocouples give a small voltage (about 6 µV per °C near room temperature), so near room
  temperature the reading moves in steps of about 0.2 °C and depends strongly on the meter's microvolt accuracy; they are
  meant for high temperatures.

Tip: a probe read with the wrong setting shows a wrong temperature: a J probe at 100 °C reads about 122 °C with the K
setting (meter at 25 °C). Set `tc` to the probe you plug in.

## Display level

- **Where:** page `dSP`: `dSP 1` (default, as the original) or `dSP 2`.
- **What it does:** the meter averages its last few readings before showing them, so the last digit stays steady; a big
  change still shows immediately. With `dSP 2` that averaging is four times shorter, so small changes and slow drifts
  appear about four times sooner (in AC volts a small step: 0.24 s instead of 0.96 s). How often the digits update does
  not change in any function: that is set by the measuring chip (the 50 mV range, for example, updates more slowly than
  the 500 mV range). Only changes smaller than a few digits are averaged; in mV, where that is a few microvolts, `dSP` is
  hardly visible.
- **Cost:** the last digit can be a little less steady (for example a temperature that toggles between 99.9 and 100.0).

Tip: `dSP 2` while adjusting a trimmer or watching something warm up or charge; `dSP 1` for the steadiest reading.

## Limit test (pass / fail)

1. Put a known-good part (or source) at the **low** limit on the probes. SETUP to `Lo`, hold **SETUP**, press **REL**: the
   reading is captured. Hold **SETUP** to finish. The page then shows `Lo` and the captured value in turn.
2. The same with a part at the **high** limit on the page `HI`.
3. On `Lt`: hold **SETUP**, press **REL** (`LtOn`), hold **SETUP**: the small display now shows the verdict for every
   reading: `PASS` inside the limits, `HI` above, `Lo` below (an overload counts as `HI` or `Lo`). Leaving the limits
   gives the refusal beep, coming back the accept beep.
- While the test is on the range stays fixed (RANGE is refused); turning the dial ends the test. The limits are kept
  until the meter is switched off.
- Switching on is refused (refusal beep) until both limits are captured in the present function and range.

Tip: check a box of resistors without reading a single number: capture 99 ohm and 101 ohm, then every part shows `PASS`
or not.

## Logging trigger

Logging to the SD card is started and stopped as before (hold **MEM**). The page `tr` chooses when a record is written:

- `tr-In` (default, as the original): every interval (page `In`, seconds; 0 = about 5 records per second).
- `tr-Ch`: when the reading has changed by at least the threshold of the page `Ch` (1 to 255 counts, in the last digit
  of the reading) since the last record; checked once per second. With an interval above 0 a record is also written
  every interval.
- `tr-Lt`: when the limit test verdict changes (PASS / HI / Lo); with an interval above 0 also every interval while the
  reading is outside the limits.

The files have the same format as the original's, with one addition: the two closing rows `MAX,...` and `MIN,...` end
with the date and time of the row that held the maximum and the minimum, for example
`MAX,7,DCV,01.5000,V,2026/11/02,23:40:52,`. The first five columns are as before.

Tip: `tr-Ch` with `Ch 10` and interval 0 records a slowly drifting value only when it actually moves, so a long session
stays short and readable.

## 4–20 mA loop in percent (DC mA)

- **Where:** in DC mA (mA jack, dial A), page `LP`: `LPOFF` (default: the current, as the original), `L4-20`, `L0-20`.
- **Effect:** the main display shows the loop signal as a percentage with the % sign: 4 mA = 0.00 %, 12 mA = 50.00 %,
  20 mA = 100.00 % (with `L0-20`: 0 mA = 0 %, 20 mA = 100 %). Below 4 mA it goes negative, so a broken loop (0 mA) shows
  -25.00 %. Logging, Bluetooth and MIN/MAX keep the current in mA.

Tip: with `L4-20` a sensor's output reads directly in percent of its range, for example a pressure transmitter at 63.50 %.

## Firmware update over Bluetooth

- **On the meter:** Bluetooth on (hold PEAK), then press SETUP until `SEt`, hold SETUP until the long beep (the meter
  pages), and press SETUP until the page `Ld-bt` (right after `bt`).
- **On the computer:** `python emulator/tools/bt_upload.py EEVBlog.bin` (Python 3 with the package `bleak`: `pip install
  bleak`). The meter shows the progress in percent (`Ld 45`), a full image takes a few minutes.
- **Result:** `Ld oK` means the file is on the card as `EEVBlog.bin` and was read back correctly (the temporary file
  `BTLOAD.TMP` is deleted). `LdE n` means it was not stored (1 card problem, 2 the file arrived damaged, 3 not a firmware
  file, 4 the copy failed, 5 the copy reads back differently, 10 a packed transfer arrived damaged); start the transfer again or copy the file with a computer.
  After `LdE 4` or `LdE 5` the card holds either the old `EEVBlog.bin` untouched or none at all (a partly written one is
  deleted, so the update key sequence then leaves the installed firmware unchanged).
- **Then update as usual:** switch off, hold HOLD and MEM while switching on, then press SETUP. With the two-part
  bootloader installed (next section) the companion does this step itself: no keys.
- Logging must be off. The meter keeps measuring during the transfer. Leaving the page stops it; the old `EEVBlog.bin`
  stays until a new file has arrived complete and checked.

## Connecting the 121GW Companion

- **Do not pair the meter** in the Bluetooth settings of Windows, macOS or Linux. The Companion finds the meter by
  itself. A meter that the computer has paired is kept connected by the computer, does not advertise and can no longer be
  found (GitHub issue 23).
- **If you paired it already:** remove it in the computer's Bluetooth settings (Windows: Settings > Bluetooth & devices,
  `121GW`, the three dots, Remove device), switch the meter's Bluetooth off and on (hold PEAK twice), start the Companion.
- **One connection at a time:** close any other Bluetooth app for the meter before using the Companion.
- **After an update over Bluetooth** the meter switches Bluetooth on by itself, so the Companion reconnects and
  confirms the update (firmware 1.2.2 with bootloader 1.1.4 or newer; GitHub issue 23). With an older bootloader, and
  after the one update that installs bootloader 1.1.4, hold PEAK to switch Bluetooth on.
- **A link that hangs is repaired by itself** (firmware 1.2.6 with Companion 1.2.32; GitHub issue 23): while the
  Companion is connected it sends a one-byte "still here" every 5 s.  If the meter hears nothing for 15 s it switches its
  Bluetooth module off for 5 s and on again, so a computer that kept the connection (Windows was seen to) must let it go
  and the Companion reconnects.  The Companion in turn asks the meter when no reading has come for 8 s and reconnects
  when it does not answer; when the meter stays unreachable for a minute it says so in a window.  A clean Disconnect
  switches the meter's watch off first; other Bluetooth apps never switch it on.

## Card files and settings from the companion (page `Ld-bt`)

With the meter on the SETUP page `Ld-bt` (Bluetooth on, logging off, not in calibration mode), the 121GW Companion can:

- **list the card's files** (root folder, long names), **download** them (about 1 KB/s, every piece checked with a CRC),
  **delete** them (`cal.bin`, `EEVBlog.bin` and `BTLOAD.TMP` cannot be deleted), show the free space, and copy new or
  changed files into a folder on the computer ("sync");
- **read and change the settings** of the SETUP pages: thermocouple type, temperature unit, dBm reference, display level,
  continuity threshold and hold, Bluetooth speed, auto power-off, backlight auto-off, contrast, VA burden, buzzer, REL
  view, logging trigger and change threshold, 12-hour clock, current-loop and RTD views, the capacitance anti-hunting
  (`HUnt`, F-1.16 or newer), battery trim, battery type and the current clamp setting (F-1.35 or newer).  A change is
  stored exactly as the page itself stores it; calibration, serial number and the rotary memory cannot be reached.  The
  logging interval is set on the meter only.

With F-1.17 or newer the companion can also take the meter off the page `Ld-bt` (button **Leave Ld-bt** on its CARD
view): the meter goes to the next SETUP page, as with a SETUP press, and the readings come back.

Nothing is written to the card except the deletes you confirm.  While the companion uses the card the readings pause
(the page `Ld` owns the link).

## Extended link diagnosis (F-1.15 or newer)

- **What it is for:** a problem report about damaged data on the Bluetooth link. With it the meter counts what happens on
  its Bluetooth serial line (USART2): bytes received, bytes lost (overruns), noise flags, framing errors, bytes discarded
  during a card session, key and set-clock frames rejected, page `Ld` packets answered "CRC wrong" and answers it could not
  queue for lack of room, plus the battery voltage. The numbers show whether damage arises in the meter, on the radio or in
  the computer.
- **How:** in the 121GW Companion's SETTINGS view switch **Extended diagnosis** on (it is **off by default**). The Companion
  then tells the meter to count each time it connects; **Save report** on the METER view puts the counts into the
  report file to attach to a GitHub issue.
- **On the meter:** the counting is a RAM flag that is 0 at every reset; it is never written to the EEPROM or the flash, the
  counters start at 0 when counting is switched on, and counting changes nothing else on the link. Older firmware ignores
  the request.
- **The meter's clock (F-1.17 or newer):** at power-on and at every wake from auto power-off the meter measures its RC run
  clock against its crystal, trims it, and sets the Bluetooth serial speed from the measurement. With **Extended
  diagnosis** on, the report has a section "meter clock": the clock as found, after the trim, and the resulting serial
  speed. Nothing to set; nothing is stored.

## Old Bluetooth module (link 2, F-1.31 or newer)

Early meters (v.01 boards, Bluegiga BLE112-A module) damage single bytes on the Bluetooth link and carry only about 150
bytes a second. The 121GW Companion (1.3.0 or newer) recognises them by themselves and switches link 2 on: the readings
come in small blocks with repair bytes, only what changed is sent, so the meter's full reading rate (bt) gets through and
a damaged byte is repaired; with F-1.32 the card list, downloads and settings come in the same repaired blocks. Nothing
to set; the Meter page and the report say "link 2". With older firmware the companion shows the readings as they come
and suggests the update. Newer meters (BGM220S module) are not affected.

## Packed downloads and updates (F-1.32, bootloader B-1.15)

With firmware F-1.32 the meter packs card files before it sends them (log files shrink to about 14 %), and with
F-1.32 on page Ld or the bootloader B-1.15 the 121GW Companion sends updates packed (the firmware to about two thirds).
Both work on every meter and every Bluetooth module; nothing to set. If anything arrives damaged the transfer stops with
LdE10 (page Ld) or LdE 7 (update mode, which stays in update mode) and is simply sent again; the meter checks every
update as before, so a damaged one is never used.

## Two-part bootloader (with the 121GW Companion)

The two-part bootloader (`bootloader/README.md`, releases `bl-vA.B.C`) replaces EEVblog's. The fast build supports it in two
ways, both used by the companion program (releases `companion-vA.B.C`):

- **First install:** the companion sends the install file over the same page `Ld-bt` (start the transfer on that page:
  SETUP until `SEt`, hold SETUP until the long beep, then SETUP until `Ld-bt`). The meter checks that its bootloader area is one of EEVblog's builds and that the battery is at least
  4.80 V, writes the new bootloader, restarts, and the starter installs it. Extra `LdE` codes: `LdE 7` the bootloader area is
  not one of EEVblog's builds (nothing written), `LdE 8` battery below 4.80 V (nothing written), `LdE 9` the install file or
  a flash step failed.
- **Update requests:** once the two-part bootloader is installed, the companion can ask the running firmware to restart into
  the bootloader's update mode, and can ask for the bootloader version (`B-` and three digits, or `B-EEV` for EEVblog's).
  The firmware and bootloader updates then run over Bluetooth with nothing to press on the meter. With EEVblog's bootloader
  the restart request does nothing; the card and key sequence above is the way.

The card update (HOLD + MEM at power-on, SETUP) keeps working with the two-part bootloader.

## Format the SD card (exFAT)

- **Where:** SETUP page `Fr`, right after `Ld-bt`.  It appears only when the meter has the new two-part bootloader
  (`bootloader/README.md`): EEVblog's original bootloader cannot read exFAT, so its card update would stop working.
- **How:** hold SETUP until `Fr no` blinks, press REL (or PEAK) for `Fr yE`, hold SETUP again.  `Fr --` while it works,
  then `Fr oK`.  **Everything on the card is erased.**  `FrE n` means the format failed (n = the FatFs result),
  `FrE L`: refused because logging is running or calibration mode is on.
- **From the computer (F-1.09 or newer):** with Bluetooth on and the page `Ld-bt` shown, the 121GW Companion's CARD view
  has **Format card**: type FORMAT to confirm, then a window stays open until the meter has finished.
- The meter reads and writes FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT cards, with long file names (cards larger than 32 GB come
  formatted as exFAT).

## Battery voltage trim

- **Where:** SETUP page `BAT` (the battery voltage, the page after the temperature unit).
- **Use:** measure the meter's battery with another meter. Hold SETUP until the page shows `bA` and the voltage with two
  decimals, press REL (up) or PEAK (down) until it matches (steps of 0.2 %, at most ±10 %), then hold SETUP to save.
  A short SETUP leaves without saving.
- **Why:** the battery is measured through two resistors whose tolerance varies from meter to meter by a few percent; the
  trim corrects your meter. The low-battery symbol then also comes at the right voltage.

## Battery type and the battery at power-on

- **Where:** SETUP page `bAt`, the page right after the battery page in the meter pages (on `SEt` hold **SETUP**).
  `bAtAL` is alkaline (the default, as the original), `bAtnH` is NiMH. Hold SETUP to edit (the display blinks), press REL
  or PEAK to switch, hold SETUP to save; a short SETUP leaves without saving.
- **Low-battery warning:** the battery symbol comes below 4.1 V with alkaline cells (as the original) and below 4.7 V with
  NiMH cells. Writing settings to the meter stays refused below 4.1 V for both types.
- **At power-on:** when the start-up window (about 2 s with the version on the display) is over, the sub display shows the
  battery voltage for 2 s, for example `4.95` with the V sign, in the function you switched on in. Any key press, a turn
  of the dial or a message ends it. It is not shown in the VA functions (their small display switches between V and A),
  nor in calibration mode or date-code mode. If the battery is below the limit of the chosen type,
  the battery symbol is on and the double beep sounds once (silent with the buzzer off, sounding with `qUiEt`). This also
  applies when the meter wakes up from auto power-off.

## Current clamp (voltage-output clamp read in amperes, F-1.35 or newer)

- **Where:** SETUP page `CLP` in the V and mV functions (DC V, AC V, DC mV, AC mV), right after `dSP`. The main display shows
  `CLP` and the sub display the setting: `oFF` (the default: volts, as always), `1`, `10`, `100` or `1000` - the millivolts
  your clamp gives for one ampere (`1000` is 1 V per A). Hold SETUP to edit (the sub display blinks), press REL (up) or
  PEAK (down), hold SETUP to save; a short SETUP leaves without saving.
- **Effect:** the main display shows the current in amperes: the same digits as the voltage, with the decimal point moved,
  and the A sign instead of V. Examples: 10 mV per A, DC V reads 0.2534 V: the display shows `25.34` A; 1 mV per A, DC mV
  reads 253.40 mV: `253.40` A; 100 mV per A, DC mV reads 50.000 mV: `500.00` mA (the m sign lights when the amperes would
  need more than four decimals). When the current does not fit the five digits (1 mV per A and 100.00 V on the
  display: that would be 100 000 A) the display shows `OFL`.
- **What stays as it is:** the measurement itself, MIN/MAX, statistics, HOLD, REL (REL shows the difference in amperes),
  the bargraph and its labels, the high-voltage sign. The pages `Sd`, `tHI`, `tLo` and the MEM view show volts. The
  Bluetooth frame carries the setting for the companion apps; the SD card log (page `In`, MEM held) writes the main
  reading in A or mA with the same decimal point.
- **Note:** the meter's own accuracy and range limits are those of the voltage reading; with a clamp the usable current
  range is the voltage range divided by the setting.

## PT100 / PT1000 temperature sensors (Ω)

- **Where:** in Ω (dial Ω, resistance function), page `Pt`: `PtOFF` (default: the resistance, as the original), `Pt100`,
  `P1000`.
- **Effect:** the main display shows the temperature of a platinum sensor (IEC 60751, the usual "385" type) with 0.1 °,
  in °C or °F as chosen for the temperature function, from -200.0 to 850.0 °C (outside: `OFL` / `-OFL`). Logging,
  Bluetooth and MIN/MAX keep the resistance in Ω.
- **Lead resistance:** the meter measures with two wires, so the test leads add to the sensor: 0.1 Ω reads about
  0.26 °C high with a PT100. To remove it, press RANGE until the sensor's range is shown (PT100: 500.00 Ω, PT1000:
  5.0000 kΩ), short the leads, press REL, then connect the sensor. A PT1000 is ten times less affected.

## Continuity beep hold time

- **Where:** in the continuity (BEEP) function, page `bH`: `bH100` (default, as the original), `bH 50`, `bH 25`, `bHOFF`.
- **Effect:** how long the beep continues after the probes lose contact: 100, 50 or 25 ms, or with `bHOFF` about 15 ms,
  the shortest time that still gives a clean, unbroken beep on a steady contact. The beep still starts about 1 to 6 ms
  after contact.

Tip: `bH100` makes even the shortest touch audible (good for scratching along a trace); `bHOFF` shows intermittent
contacts as broken beeps.

## Continuity with your own threshold (beep on a short or on an open)

- **Where:** in the continuity (BEEP) function, the threshold page (press SETUP once): besides the fixed thresholds
  `DN  1` .. `DN300` and `UP  1` .. `UP300` there are `DNUSr` (after `DN300`) and `UPUSr` (after `UP300`).
  - `DNUSr` beeps while the reading is at or below your threshold: a short, as the `DN` thresholds.
  - `UPUSr` beeps while the reading is at or above it: an open. This finds intermittent connections: connect the probes
    across the joint, cable or switch and the meter stays silent while it conducts and beeps when it breaks.
- **Your threshold and hysteresis:** with `DNUSr` or `UPUSr` chosen, SETUP goes on from `bH` to two more pages:
  - `th` the threshold, `th  1` .. `th500` Ω in 1 Ω steps (30 Ω until you set it);
  - `HY` the hysteresis, `HY 0.1` .. `HY25.0` Ω in 0.1 Ω steps (5.0 Ω until you set it).
  Hold SETUP to edit (the value blinks), REL raises, PEAK lowers (hold the key to step faster; both wrap around), hold
  SETUP again to save; a short SETUP leaves without saving.
- **Effect:** the beep starts at the threshold; once it sounds it continues until the reading is the hysteresis past the
  threshold (above it for `DNUSr`, below it for `UPUSr`), so a reading close to the threshold does not make the beep
  chatter. With `UPUSr` and a hysteresis as large as the threshold, the beep, once on, continues down to 0.01 Ω.
- The beep hold time `bH` works for these too. The settings are kept in three spare bytes of the meter's memory, apart
  from the calibration, the serial number and the other options.

## Capacitance anti-hunting (CAP)

- **The problem:** with some ceramic capacitors of about 100 nF the capacitance range keeps changing (100 nF, 1 µF, 100 nF,
  …): the digits stay blank and only the decimal point moves. Each range change blanks the display, and the capacitor
  never gets a chance to be measured on one range. (Reported on the EEVblog forum; why those capacitors behave so is not
  proven.)
- **Where:** page `HUnt`, in CAP mode only, after `dSP` and before `CL`. Four letters leave no room for the value on the
  sub display, so the sub display shows `HUnt` and the main display shows `oFF` (the default, as the original) or `on`.
  Long SETUP starts the edit (the sub display blinks), REL or PEAK switches, long SETUP saves.
- **What it does with `on`:** after the 100 nF range has found no result twice in a row, the meter stays on the 1 µF
  range and shows the value (about `0.095` µF for 95 nF) as long as the capacitor reads 10 to 99.9 nF there. It lets go and
  ranges as usual when a different capacitor is connected (the reading changes by more than 20 %), when a result comes on
  the 100 nF range, with open probes, when you change the range by hand or press REL, when you change the function and at
  power-off. The 1 µF range has one digit less than the 100 nF range (0.0950 µF instead of 95.00 nF).
- **Only needed** if your capacitor shows the hunting; leave it `oFF` otherwise. It only acts in CAP auto range.

## Diode contact chirp

- **The idea** (GitHub PR 22, @Cecilius): in the diode function the double beep reports a jump of the reading, so
  touching a diode beeps, lifting the probes beeps, and a reading that settles or drifts can beep again. With the contact
  chirp the double beep means one thing: a diode is connected.
- **Where:** page `CHIrP`, in the diode function only, after `dSP` and before `CL`. Like `HUnt`, the name fills the sub
  display and the main display shows `oFF` (the default, as the original) or `on`. Long SETUP starts the edit (the sub
  display blinks), REL or PEAK switches, long SETUP saves.
- **What it does with `on`:** one double beep about 0.2 s after a diode is connected; nothing more while it stays
  connected, nothing with open probes or a reversed diode (the reading shows overload), and nothing when you lift the
  probes. A short bounce of the probe gives no second beep. The next diode beeps again once the probes have been open or
  shorted for about 0.2 s.
- The continuous tone of shorted probes is unchanged, and the buzzer setting (page 3) silences the diode beeps as before.
  On the 15 V range a forward voltage below about 1 V reads like shorted probes, as in the original firmware.

## Statistics (MIN/MAX)

- **Where:** press **MIN/MAX** as usual; the small display now shows `n` and the number of readings collected (from 10000
  in thousands with the k sign). Press **SETUP** for `Sd`: the main display then shows the **standard deviation** of the
  readings, in the unit of the reading and with one more decimal where the range allows. Press **SETUP** again to return
  to the normal pages.
- The statistics use the same readings as the MIN/MAX average (HOLD pauses them, overloads are left out) and restart each
  time MIN/MAX is switched on. With fewer than two readings `Sd` shows `-----`.

Tip: leave the probes on a source for a while with MIN/MAX on; `Sd` tells how much the reading wanders, `n` how many
readings that is based on.

**When did the maximum and the minimum happen?** Press **SETUP** once more after `Sd`: the small display shows `tHI` and
the main display the time of the maximum as hours-minutes (`14-32`, in the 12- or 24-hour form chosen on `CL`); once more
for `tLo`, the time of the minimum; once more to return to the normal pages. `-----` means there is no maximum or
minimum yet. The times are kept until MIN/MAX is switched off. If the maximum is an overload, `tHI` shows the time of the
first overload.

Tip: start MIN/MAX in the evening on a supply rail, read `tLo` in the morning to see when it sagged.

## 12-hour clock

- **Where:** page `CL`: `CL 24` (default, as the original) or `CL 12`.
- **Effect:** the time page shows the hour as 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 23, for example 14:30 as ` 2-30`. There is no AM/PM
  mark (the display has five characters and the time uses all of them).
- Setting the clock works as before (hour, then minute). Log files and Bluetooth keep 24-hour time.

## °C or °F (original feature)

The first SETUP page shows the meter's own temperature, for example ` 25.0c`. Hold **SETUP**, press **REL** to switch
between `c` and `F`, hold **SETUP** to save. The same setting switches the TEMP function between °C and °F.

## Buzzer off (original setting, both builds)

SETUP page 3 (a meter page: on `SEt` hold SETUP, then SETUP twice) shows `b-On`, `b-OFF` or `qUiEt`. Hold SETUP until
the value blinks, REL or PEAK to change, hold SETUP to save.

- `b-On`: every beep.
- `b-OFF`: the key beeps, the diode beeps (the double beep and the short tone), the auto-hold capture beep, the limit
  test beeps, the auto power-off warning and the power-off beep are silent.
- `qUiEt` (fast build F-1.24 on, GitHub issue 28): the keys are silent, the meter still beeps for what it measures: the
  diode double beep (and the contact chirp), the diode short tone, the auto-hold capture, the limit test verdicts, the auto
  power-off warning and the power-off beep.

Continuity always beeps (it is a continuity tester), and so do the wrong-jack and high-voltage warnings. (The original
also beeped for the diode short tone, auto-hold and power-off with `b-OFF`; `qUiEt` is close to that, with the diode
double beep added.) A firmware older than F-1.24 reads a saved `qUiEt` as `b-OFF`.

## Keys held while switching on (F-1.27 or newer)

Each service function needs two keys held together while the dial switches the meter on. Hold them before you turn
the dial and keep them held for half a second, until the beep:

| Hold while switching on | What happens |
|---|---|
| MEM + PEAK | cal.bin backup / restore menu `SdCAL`: then REL (save) or PEAK (restore), then MODE |
| MODE + REL | calibration mode (calibration labs only) |
| MODE + SETUP | date-code editing |
| RANGE + MIN/MAX | all segments on (display test) |
| MEM + HOLD | firmware update from the card (the bootloader; unchanged) |

A single key pressed right after switching on, or after the meter wakes from auto power-off, starts none of these
(GitHub issue 32: a MODE pressed in the first 2 s used to show `CAL1`). The original firmware and older releases use a
single key (MEM, MODE then REL, SETUP, RANGE).

## Faster responses without a setting

The fast build also reacts faster, with no setting needed:

- **Continuity beep:** about 1 to 6 ms after contact (0.75 to 5.5 ms in the emulator, whose converter timing was
  measured on a meter in 2026-11: a continuity reading every 3.9 ms).
- **Diode short tone:** designed for about 20 ms (original: 0.38 s, measured).
- **Readings:** the continuity display and the lower AC volt ranges update every 100 ms, ohms every 105 to 155 ms, DC and
  AC currents and diode every 160 ms, the highest AC volt range every 25 ms (original: about 221 ms, measured; the
  converter's speed on each range was measured on a meter in 2026-11 and the averages sized to it).
- **DC volts:** twice as many updates as the original, with the same steadiness (each value is still the average of the
  same 16 conversions, just shown twice as often). After a jump of the input the first value is the new level: the
  original could show a value in between once (for example 4.5 V when connecting 9 V).
- **Capacitance, 100 nF range (experimental):** in auto range the meter now waits 2.5 s for a result on the 100 nF range
  (original: 2.0 s, 1.5 s on some boards) before it moves to the 1 µF range. Capacitors near 100 nF that measure slowly
  stay on the 100 nF range and keep its resolution (0.01 nF per digit instead of 0.1 nF per digit on the 1 µF range). Reports welcome.
- **Auto-hold in Ω and diode:** a short (0 Ω, 0 V) is captured like any other value; the original ignored readings below
  1000 digits. Open probes (OL) are still ignored. In the volt and current functions auto-hold still ignores readings
  near zero, because there open probes read about 0.

## Problems

If something does not work as described, please open an issue on GitHub with the build (`2_fast` or `1_like_v2.05`),
what you did, what you expected and what the meter showed.
