@ =============================================================================
@ bfapi.s - BLE: the meter API - settings, the meter's state and any SETUP page over Bluetooth on every screen
@ (production image only, DESIGN.md 10 IMP-65, FEATURES.md 2.39)
@
@ Owner 2026-11-09: "make yourself a interface in the meter that can directly choose the settings and allow inputs
@ directly"; "its like a meter api with all commands in it you can run".  Before this module the settings requests
@ (ble/bftset.s) were taken only while the page Ld was shown, and nothing told the computer which page the meter showed
@ (in BEEP every page sends the threshold code in the status frame).
@
@ Packets.  The B5 5B packet of ble/bft.s (B5 5B type seq(2) len payload crc16(2), CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over type .. payload)
@ with a payload of at most API_MAXPAY bytes (inc/config.inc) is now also taken outside the page Ld: the key / clock parser of the USART2
@ handler (ble/usart.s) recognises the first byte 0xB5 and collects the packet in ble_rx_buf (20 bytes), and the command
@ step (ble/commands.s fn_0800C332) passes it here.  Answers are the type 0x82 answer of ble/bftsd.s (bfx_reply), sent
@ from the transmit queue between status frames (on link 2 inside TEXT blocks).
@     0x16 GET   as ble/bftset.s
@     0x17 PUT   as ble/bftset.s (the setting is changed and saved exactly as its page does)
@     0x1B WHERE no payload.  Answer: status 0, field = API_VERSION, data (API_WHERE_LEN bytes):
@                [0] dial position (dial_latched), [1] meter_mode, [2] set_item (the SETUP page), [3] set_edit,
@                [4] flags: bit 0 page Ld owns the link, 1 logging, 2 MEM view, 3 calibration mode, 4 MIN/MAX on,
@                    5 power-on window open, 6 restart due (bootloader install done)
@     0x1C SHOW  payload item(1): show that SETUP page.  The meter takes the same steps as short SETUP presses
@                (fn_08015410, key/short.s .Lsh_setup_next without the beep) until set_item is the item; a page of the
@                meter walk (items 1..8, 20, 21, 25, 39, 40, 44, 47) is reached from the page SEt with what a long SETUP
@                does there (set_menu_enter).  Every page passed loads what it loads under the keys (no logic is
@                copied).  At most API_STEPS steps; a page that does not exist in this function (or this state) is
@                not reached: the meter walks back to the page it showed and answers 0x22.  Status 0, field = the item.
@     any other type: status 3.
@ The page Ld (bft_packet) also takes WHERE and SHOW (its own GET / PUT stay as they were).
@ Refusals (status 3): calibration mode and a restart due (every type but WHERE); for PUT and SHOW also logging, the MEM
@ view, the power-on window open (exactly the states in which short SETUP does not walk, key/short.s .Lsh_key_setup)
@ and, for SHOW, a page being edited (set_edit; PUT checks it itself).
@ A packet with a wrong CRC, a second byte other than 0x5B or a length that does not match is dropped (counted in
@ xd_bad_frames); the sender repeats when no answer comes.
@
@ Calibration, serial and options: nothing here writes the EEPROM; PUT goes through ble/bftset.s and set_nvm_store
@ (SETTINGS class only) as on the page Ld, SHOW only moves between pages.
@
@ Context: main only (fn_0800C332, bft_packet).
