@ =============================================================================
@ relpct.s - UI: REL in percent, a view of the REL reading (production image only, DESIGN.md 10 IMP-11, FEATURES.md 2.3)
@
@ v2.05 REL (fn_0800E594) replaces the reading D (0x20007D64) by x - base, the base 0x20007DA8 being the first result after
@ REL was switched on (or the last MIN/MAX reading).  With the SETUP page rEL set to percent (set_relp = 1) the main display
@ shows instead
@     p = (x - base) / base * 100 % = D * 100 / base %
@ with the decimal point placed by magnitude: 0.001 % resolution (xx.xxx) while |p| < 100 %, then 0.01, 0.1 and 1 %
@ (up to 99999 %); above that " OFL " (the reading itself is not an overload: the OL flag is not touched); a base of 0 has
@ no percent: "-----".  Every step rounds half away from zero once, from the exact quotient (no double rounding).
@ Only the main display changes: D, the logging, MIN/MAX and the BLE frame keep the REL value in counts (0x20007D70, the
@ value the BLE frame reports, is set to D after the percent is drawn, as v2.05 does for its REL overflow path
@ 0x08017046..0x08017078).
@
@ When the view is shown: exactly when v2.05 lights the REL sign (FUN_08019F2E 0x08019F82: rel_active != 0, 0x20007FE1 = 0,
@ 0x20007FE4 = 0) and set_relp = 1.  While it is shown, the unit and prefix signs of the main reading are off and the %
@ sign (Sub%, w0b17, the sign DUTY uses for its reading) is on.  The mask is applied to the shadow at every full commit
@ (lcd_commit_shadow; the partial commit writes bargraph bits only, analysis/lcd_map.md 1), so it holds whatever routine
@ redrew a sign before; when the view ends the redraw of every annunciator (0x20008060) and of the unit prefix (0x20008061)
@ is requested, which restores the signs of the mode.
@ Unit and prefix signs (analysis/lcd_map.md 4.1): w0 b8 k, b9 u, b11 M; w2 b8 Ohm, b9 n, b10 m; w4 b8 Hz, b9 F, b10 V,
@ b11 degC; w6 b10 A, b11 degF; w6 b0 ms (PULSE), left alone while peak hold shows "1ms" with it (0x200080B7).
@ Mode signs (LowZ, Beep, Diode), AC/DC and the status signs are not touched.
@
@ Context: main only.
