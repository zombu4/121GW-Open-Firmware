@ hunt.s - UI: the value of the SETUP pages HUnt and CHIrP on the main display (production image only, DESIGN.md 10
@ IMP-45, IMP-51, FEATURES.md 2.19, 2.25)
@
@ The page HUnt (setup item 41, CAP only, set/relp.s) switches the capacitance anti-hunting rule (mres/antihunt.s).  Its
@ name needs four of the five characters of the sub display, so the sub display shows "HUnt " (set_hunt_draw) and, as the
@ pages Sd, tHI and tLo do with their values, the main display shows the value: "   on" or "  oFF".  While the page is
@ selected fn_08016E08 calls ui_hunt_draw in place of the reading draw (before its blank rule: the CAP range jumps of a
@ hunting capacitor would otherwise blank the digits that the page shows); ui_relpct_mask applies no REL percent view
@ to it.  The unit signs of the range stay as the reading has them.  The BLE value 0x20007D70 is not changed.
@ The page CHIrP (setup item 42, DIODE only, set/chirp.s, IMP-51) has the same layout: "CHIrP" on the sub display and its
@ value (set_chirp_on) on the main display, drawn here in the same way.
@ The page CLP (setup item 48, DCV, ACV, DCmV and ACmV, set/clp.s, IMP-68) is the other way round: its value (the clamp
@ ratio) is on the sub display and ui_hunt_draw writes the name "  CLP" on the main display, so that the live voltage
@ is not shown under the page.
@
@ Context: main only.
